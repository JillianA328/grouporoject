# Project 1 - What's For Dinner App

## Project Description
This project, assigned by Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, required the creation of an online application utilizing all of the skills acquired from class thus far. Our project concept was to streamline the process for determining what one would like to eat for dinner, whether it be take out or utilizing the ingredients they have at home to make a delicious meal based on an online recipe. The goal of this application was to create a user interface that would allow a user to search for recipes online that they could cook at home or search for restaurants in their area.
